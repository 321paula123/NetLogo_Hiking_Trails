A video demonstration of this project can be found at www.paula-young.com.

This project models the movement of pedestrians through the region of Grayson Highlands State Park.
The movement of park visitors is based on their terrain preferences (flat vs. steep routes), and the amount of time they want to hike.
The sliders can be adjusted to change the preferred path of visitors through the park.
